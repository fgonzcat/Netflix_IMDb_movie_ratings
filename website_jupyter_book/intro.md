# Netflix Movies with Best IMDb Ratings 🎬⭐

I created a website to rank Netflix movies from best to worst according to [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com).  The idea is that you don't have to waste time searching for "what to watch": you just go to the site, choose a genre, and that's it. It's perfect for when you don't know what to watch and don't want to spend 30 minutes browsing.

⭐ IMDb scale:
1–3 😴 | 4–5 💣 | 6 🤔 | 7 👍 | 8+ 🌟

- 😴 = Very boring
- 💣 = Likely bad
- 🤔 = Might be good
- 👍 = Very likely good
- 🌟 = Excellent
