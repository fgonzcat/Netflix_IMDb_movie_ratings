## Why this exists

Because I got tired of manually searching every Netflix movie on the internet just to find its IMDb rating before deciding what to watch.

So I automated it.


```{tip}
 If you’re curious *how* these lists are made, check the [**“How it works”**](how_it_works) section   and run the scripts locally on your own machine.
